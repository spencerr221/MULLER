    """Utility that reads raw data from supported files into MULLER format.

        - Recompresses data into format required by the tensor if permitted by the tensor htype.
        - Copies data in the file if file format matches sample_compression of the tensor, to maximize upload speeds.
    Args:
        path (str): Path to a supported file.
        verify (bool):  If True, contents of the file are verified.
        creds (optional, Dict): Credentials for s3, gcp and http urls.
        compression (optional, str): Format of the file. Only required if path does not have an extension.
        storage (optional, StorageProvider): Storage provider to use to retrieve remote files.
                                             Useful if multiple files are being read from same storage
                                             to minimize overhead of creating a new provider.

    Returns:
        Sample: Sample object. Call ``sample.array`` to get the ``np.ndarray``.
